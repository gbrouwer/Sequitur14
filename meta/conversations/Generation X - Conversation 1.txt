# Generation X - Conversation 3

## Summary:
This conversation focused on refining preprocessing and keyword extraction for an AI trend detection pipeline, with specific emphasis on stopword filtering.

---

## Key Milestones:

### ðŸ”¹ Project Summary
- Reviewed the current architecture: data scraping, TF-IDF, LDA, and BERTopic analysis on ArXiv AI papers.
- Identified preprocessing and stopword filtering as key improvement areas before trend detection.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Preprocessing Improvements
- Added apostrophe normalization and contraction expansion to `ArxivPreprocessor`.
- Made contraction expansion configurable via `expand_contractions` (default=True).
- Passed flag through `run_preprocessing.py` and `main.py`.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Multi-file Coding Convention
- Adopted a file-aware header style:
  ```
  # === FILE: filename.py ===
  # === CHANGE: description of change ===
  ```

---

### ðŸ”¹ General Stopword List
- Created `stopwords_general_english_top_1000.txt`
  - Merged from NLTK, spaCy, and Scikit-learn.
  - 406 alphabetically sorted entries.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Scientific Stopword List
- Discussed use of Academic Word List (AWL).
- Generated:
  - `stopwords_scientific_english_top_1000.txt` (partial AWL subset)
  - `stopwords_scientific_english_awl_full.txt` (full AWL, 555 entries)

---

### ðŸ”¹ Next Steps (Deferred)
- Merge general + AWL stopwords.
- Run TF-IDF on filtered corpus.
- Begin trend detection on high-value, domain-specific terms.

---

### âœ… Pause Point
User will:
- Integrate changes locally,
- Fetch a larger ArXiv sample,
- Return for trend modeling.
